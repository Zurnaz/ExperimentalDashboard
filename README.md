## Intro

Initially just practice to play about with creating various c# service interfaces and creating visualisations based on the data received.
The data and visualisations ended up being more interesting. There are far simpler ways to display a small dataset than with a microservice backend espcially if the data is static with at most monthly updates.

### (Datasets not included)

## Population over time

Displays cities population sizes relative to each other by max population size between two dates.

## UK consular assistance data (not complete)

Compare two cities with the types and number of times assistence is requested
